    <br>
    <p>While working with the Art Director at Essential StaffCARE, I had the opportunity to work on sales pieces. This is an example of a booth I designed for use at tradeshows. This gave me experience in design for large scale printing, and I had to work closely with the booth vendor to make sure everything was printed in the highest quality. I stuck to brand standards for color and typography.</p>

    <h2 class="interior"><strong>Skills:</strong> Layout and Design</h2>
    <br>
    <p>As Enrollment Design Manager, I create all employee facing materials. IAG has 3 sister brands, so I create the enrollment materials for all three brands. I create standard materials, such as postcards and rate sheets, that can be customized to any client but I also create custom pieces per group request. These pieces are important because they provide clarity to employees about their Health Insurance offerings. The design challenge is to make them engaging and informative when the topic is insurance, which can be confusing and overwhelming at times. The ability to engage with and explain a complex topic to employees is important in order to achieve high enrollment.</p>

    <h2 class="interior"><strong>Skills:</strong> Template Design and Management, Layout</h2>
    <br>
    <p> One of my main responsibilities as Enrollment Design Manager at ESC is template design and management. This is an example of our most current Enrollment Form. These forms are updated each year to meet Federal and State Regulations for Health Insurance. My challenge is to take legal and administrative jargon and make the forms simple to understand for the end user - the employee signing up for health insurance. The other challenge is that each group's forms need to be customized to their plan and since ESC has over 1,000 clients with over 250 different plan configurations, designing and managing these forms has been a testament to my organization skills. I have been able to decrease turn around time per groupâ€™s forms using my layout and InDesign knowledge and background. On top of designing, I am also in charge of print production. I work closely with our print vendor to ensure materials are delivered to groups in a timely, efficient manner while also managing cost and staying on budget.

    <h2 class="interior"><strong>Client:</strong> Kennedy Museum of Art</h2>
    <h2 class="interior"><strong>Skills:</strong> Layout and Design</h2>
    <br>
    <p>While I was a student at Ohio University, I worked at the Kennedy Museum of Art. In this position, I designed all promotional materials for the museum and I was also in charge of printing those materials. I had a lot of creative freedom and was usually just given content and dimensions. I worked mainly in InDesign for these projects and was able to express my creativity through my design choices. My audience was students at Ohio University and my challenge was to engage the students and inspire them to visit the museum. This experience allowed me to explore layout for marketing more fully and allowed me to try out new typographic styles and techniques.</p>
